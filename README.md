# pathfinding

Find minimal paths on a graph, implemented in several languages.

## Input

The program must read its input from stdin.
The input represents the adjacency matrix of an arbitrary simple graph.
The input will be encoded as a JSON number array array, where each number is always `0` or `1`.
More, the lengths of the inner arrays and the length of the outer array will always be the same.
The program must parse and handle all valid input as described above.

## Output

The program must write its output to stdout.
The output must be a valid JSON number array array.
Each inner array represents a minimal-length path from a randomly-selected start node to a randomly-selected end node (with nodes labeled by integers).
The program must find all minimal paths from the start to the end, or yield and empty array if no path exists connecting the start and end.
The outer array need not be in any particular order.

## Example

**Input:**

```
[[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,0]]
```

_Program labels nodes `0, 1, 2, 3` and randomly selects `2` and `3` as start and end._

**Output:**

`[[2,1,3],[2,4,3]]`
